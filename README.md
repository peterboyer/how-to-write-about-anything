# How To Write About Anything

1. Identify the end objective.
  - e.g. a short summary, an analysis, a paragraph, an essay
1. Identify key methods of getting to the objective.
  - e.g. use the PETAL structure (Point, Example, Technique, Analysis, Link)
1. Write out the question, highlight the keywords to focus on.
1. Identify evidence from your sources that link wit hthe keywords and the objectives.
  - find sources that are the most obvious/supportive to proving your point/objective.
1. Identify techniques from the evidence.
1. Analyse why the composer/author use that technique?
  - What does it achieve?
  - What effect does it have?
1. How does the evidence work with your point/objective?
1. Answer all these points as thoroughly as possible to make it as easy as possible for you to write about it.
1. Don't "waffle on" when analysing; keep thinking about the objective.

- How does the author portray X?
- -> They _wrote_ about X:
  - -> _How_ do they write about it?
  - -> _What techniques_ are used to emphasise it?
  - -> _What effect_ does the technique have on the meaning?
  - -> _How_ does it link back to the original question; to your objective?
